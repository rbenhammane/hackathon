# TeamMorocco Submission

## Description

My project consist of creating a network of volunteers that collaborate to link the food wasters (restaurants,  hotels, ... and even individuals) to the people that need that food.
It's a web application that offers the tools to find food wasters, gather that food in collection points and then offer it to the people in need.
So if you are a restaurant, a hotel or an individual you can register in the application as a donator and you will see all the collection points around you in a map, so you can choose to deliver the food to one of these points or propose it in the application and wait for a collector to come pick it.
If you are a collection point (and in the same time a food supplier) you can use the application as a supplier to find other suppliers around you in a map, you can also ask for food from other suppliers or propose it if you have a surplus.
Between these users, there's the collectors that collect food from donators or suppliers and carry it to destination suppliers.
And finally, there's the people that search the food that can use the application as a guest and find suppliers that offer it.
All these users are volunteers, so to make this network a geat place, there's also some social features that let them feel they are a big family. These features are ranking of users with a lists of top donators, top suppliers and top collectors displayed on the application, the possibility to communicate in the application (not yet implemented) and so on ...
